		<h2>skills</h2>
		<p>My skills have been the same most of my life, I have been playing baseball my whole life and that is my main sport but I can play any sport. I like to play sports but baseball is my favorite and what I always do. My only real goal in life is to make it in baseball. God has truly blessed me with the ability to play baseball and over the years I have learned alot from coaches and experienced players who have been in the game and around the game much longer than I have. Being around such players is truly a blessing and listening to there wisdom has ultimately made me a better all round player.  </p>

		<p>Family is important to me, family is the only people you can really trust. My family is funny and crazy, as most of my family besides my mom dad and brother live far away, i don't see them too much. I have an older brother and my mom and dad are currently together and live with me.</p>
